# Calendar App
Calendar Application with Node.js, Express and React for learning purposes. Made with ChatGPT as a test on how good could it get, most of the code was written by it (Javascript, React compoments, styles and Node.js). It also helped with the installation of local MongoDB using mongoose, but it is deployed in MongoDB Atlas on the cloud by me. Also, the build script was all written by me and fixed to be deployed in [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)

[You can preview the app here](https://calendar-app-plum.vercel.app/)

## For running de App on you machine
